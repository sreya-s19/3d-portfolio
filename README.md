Welcome to the repository for my 3D interactive portfolio website. This project is a fusion of modern web technologies and 3D graphics, designed to create an immersive and engaging showcase of my skills, projects, and journey in the field of cybersecurity.

**Live Site:** [**[Your Name]'s Portfolio**](https://[Your Live Site URL].netlify.app/)

## üåê Overview

This isn't just a standard portfolio; it's a dynamic, 3D experience built from the ground up. The goal was to move beyond static pages and create a memorable digital space that reflects my passion for technology and cybersecurity. The site features a "cyber-terminal" aesthetic, interactive 3D models, and smooth animations to guide the user through my professional story.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Immersive 3D Homepage:** A dynamic scene featuring a floating cyber grid, holographic elements, and a rotating 3D badge to welcome visitors.
-   **Interactive 3D Project Carousel:** A horizontal, sliding carousel showcasing my key projects. The active card is highlighted, and all cards have a subtle floating animation.
-   **Detailed Project Modals:** Each project in the carousel is clickable, opening a detailed modal with a "README-style" description, outlining the tech stack and features.
-   **Scrollable Content Sections:** The homepage seamlessly transitions from the 3D scene to 2D sections for Achievements, Certifications, and Research, creating a rich, layered experience.
-   **Clean & Professional Design:** A consistent dark-mode "cyber" theme across all pages, with custom fonts and glowing UI elements.
-   **Fully Responsive:** The layout and 3D scenes are designed to be functional and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
